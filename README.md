T3tris is a basic Tetris clone built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. This project is designed to run on a local server, providing a simple and engaging game experience. The game features classic Tetris mechanics with intuitive controls and a smooth UI.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay with falling blocks.
- Real-time scoring and game-over detection.
- Simple and responsive controls.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** for the structure and layout of the game.
- **CSS** for styling and visual design.
- **JavaScript** for game logic, controls, and interactivity.
- **Local Server** to serve the game on your machine (e.g., using Node.js or a simple HTTP server).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Node.js** installed (optional if you're using a local server, such as a browser's built-in server).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jamesstrohm55/t3tris.git
   cd t3tris
   ```

2. If you're using Node.js to run a local server, you can install any simple HTTP server, like `http-server`:

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   http-server
   ```

4. Open the game in your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Usage

Once the game is running, you can start playing directly in your browser. The default controls are:

- **Arrow keys** to move and rotate the falling blocks.
